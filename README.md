# BattleFortune
Dominons 5 Montecarlo Simulation: You can't cheat fate, but you can predict the future.

# Vision
Allow the user to simulate hundreds of Dominions battles. BattleFortune aims to help players to both predict battle results, and improve their scripting by providing useful statistical information about battles outcomes.

# Current Sate
In the current state, BattleFortune will run the same battle as many times as the user wants, and ouput a raw table with the results of each battle. BattleFortune only works if Atlantis is in the game, and on windows computers running Dominions 5 on Steam.
